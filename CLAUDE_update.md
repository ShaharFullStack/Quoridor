## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED 

**Problem**: Wall was spanning 3 cubes with 50%-100%-50% distribution instead of covering exactly 2 cubes with 100%-100% coverage.

**Analysis from logs**:
- Wall geometry: `CELL_SIZE * 2 = 4` units long  
- Wall placed with centering logic at `centerRow=6.5`
- Result: Wall spans from z=4 to z=8 (covers 3 cube spaces)
- Expected: Wall should cover only the 2 clicked segments

## LATEST ATTEMPTS

#### Attempted Fix #3 - Centering Logic (FAILED)
```javascript
// Added centering calculation
const centerRow = (minRow + maxRow) / 2;
const centerCol = (minCol + maxCol) / 2;
addWallMesh(seg1.wallType, centerRow, centerCol);
```
**Result**: Created 50%-100%-50% distribution across 3 cubes instead of 100%-100% across 2 cubes

#### Current Fix #4 - Proper Wall Span Positioning  
```javascript
// For horizontal walls:
x: BOARD_OFFSET + col * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE, // Center of 2-cell span
z: BOARD_OFFSET + row * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE/2 // Centered on row

// For vertical walls:
x: BOARD_OFFSET + col * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE/2, // Centered on column  
z: BOARD_OFFSET + row * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE // Center of 2-cell span
```
**Expected Result**: Wall should now cover exactly 2 cubes with 100%-100% distribution

## DEBUG LOGGING ADDED
- `handleWallClick()`: Shows which lines between cubes were clicked
- `placeWall()`: Shows wall positioning calculations  
- `addWallMesh()`: Shows exact world coordinates where wall mesh is placed

## SUMMARY OF ALL ATTEMPTS
1. **Fix #1**: Changed positioning formula - broke the game
2. **Fix #2**: Tried to place walls "between cells" - ruined positioning completely  
3. **Fix #3**: Added centering logic - created 50%-100%-50% distribution problem
4. **Fix #4**: Modified positioning to center wall on the 2-cell span properly

The key insight is that walls have `CELL_SIZE * 2` geometry and need to be positioned so they cover exactly 2 cubes, not centered between segment coordinates which causes overflow.

---

## FINAL SUCCESSFUL FIX #5

**Problem**: Fix #4 still showed centering calculation in logs, indicating the centering approach was fundamentally flawed.

**Solution**: Complete abandonment of centering approach in favor of segment-based positioning:

### Final Changes Made:
1. **placeWall()**: Use `minRow, minCol` directly as starting position
2. **addWallMesh()**: Position wall to span exactly 2 cells from starting position

```javascript
// Horizontal walls: x = col * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE (center of 2-cell span)
// Vertical walls: z = row * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE (center of 2-cell span) 
```

**Result**: Wall positioned to cover exactly the 2 clicked segments with 100%-100% distribution.

This eliminates the 50%-100%-50% overflow that occurred when centering a 4-unit wall at coordinate 2.5, which made it span from 0.5 to 4.5 (covering parts of 3 cubes instead of fully covering 2 cubes).
